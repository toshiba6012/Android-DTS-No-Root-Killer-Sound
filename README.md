# Android-DTS-No-Root-Killer-Sound
 What makes this application work is the .asoundrc if you go to /system/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf and read the configuration file it will load .asoundrc at from any partition. The rc stands for root configuration and this process is only performed preboot. To install follow the directions of the Install file. This application
 is good for Marshmallow and up.
