# Android-DTS-No-Root-Killer-Sound
 What makes this application work is the .asoundrc if you go to /system/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf and read the configuration file it will load .asoundrc from any partition root. The rc stands for root configuration and this process is only performed preboot. To install follow the directions of the Install file. This application is good for any architecture Marshmallow and up. This library isn't supported by all streaming apps I'm pretty sure Spotify is supported. For full support use your own music files and play them with Poweramp. Now I have to inform you that this is lossless audio quality and cannot be streamed to Chromecast or Bluetooth. You can only have lossless audio quality with auxiliary cable and it is necessary for DTS. Enjoy.
